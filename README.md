These are the files for my blog site.

Please create an issue if the site deployment has failed, I'll try to look at it as soon as I can.

The cool thing about a markdown blog is that I can just commit markdown files into `/posts/` and they'll automatically be turned into blog posts.

I made the decision of keeping the source code of my blog open to all in the spirit of free open source development and transparency.

More on this to come later, perhaps.

Post frontmatter example (that's the "metadata" for each markdown post):

- title: "Why are we here"
- date: "12-01-2023"
- time: "19:22"
- summary: "This post is a deep dive into the nooks and crannies of the human psyche in an attempt to rediscover something that was lost."

## Things I still have to do:

- [ ] Design the home page
- [ ] Design the posts page
- [ ] Design the posts preview
- [ ] Design the post page
- [ ] Design the 404 page
- [ ] Create a cool sidebar
- [ ] Integrate my other projects into this, somehow

Yikes  (╥﹏╥)
